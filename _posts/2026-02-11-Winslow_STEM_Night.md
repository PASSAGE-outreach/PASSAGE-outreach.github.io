We are grateful to be invited to participate in Winslow Elementary Math/STEM Night on February 11, 2026. We brought several fun demos and had a great time sharing cool science with local families. Thanks to all the volunteers who helped! 


Here are our wonderful volunteers showing off a shocking demo:
