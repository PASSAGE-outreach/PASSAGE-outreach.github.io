title: About PASSAGE Outreach
subtitle: Physics for Everyone, Led by Graduate Students
---

The graduate students at the University of Rochester's Department of Physics and Astronomy are active members of the larger Rochester community.  They lead, organize, and volunteer in events aimed at people of all ages and all levels of exeperience with science.

From twice monthly visits to the Boys and Girls Club, appearances at the Rochester Public Market and Rochester Museum and Science Center, to special events like the Halloween special effects House of Illusions, PASSAGE events keep science fun and the curiosity burning.

If you're interested in finding an upcoming event, please navigate to the **calendar of events link on the top navigation bar** of this webpage.

If you're a member of the Department of Physics and Astronomy and would like to **get involved** in our events, please use the contact info button at the bottom of this page to **email Jessica Jenick, the current Vice President of Outreach for PASSAGE**.  Professors, postdocs, and undergraduates are encouraged to get involved in outreach with the PASSAGE graduate students too!

If you're interested in doing our demos at your own institution, or at home, we will be populating our Resources pages in the future with demonstration instructions, links to build blue prints, and documentation of the building process to help make your experiences go smoother.  Please check back in the future!
