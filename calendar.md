Twice a month! STEM activity with the Boys & Girls Club

New for 2026:  From the Abacus to AI: A Portable and Hands-on Museum of Computation (funded by a student-led American Physical Society grant)

Organized by our undergraduate friends: [Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/rochester-ny/)!  Casual astronomy presentations on the third Tuesday each month at 7:30pm from scientists in a laid back pub environment.
