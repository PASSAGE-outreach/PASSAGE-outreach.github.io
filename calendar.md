## New for 2026:  From the Abacus to AI: A Portable and Hands-on Museum of Computation   

We received an APS FEd grant for a family-friendly portable computation museum where participants will explore the history of computing. The goal is to design and construct demos showing the history of computers from the abacus to neural nets, as well as document the process and make it digitally accessible so that anyone interested in similar demos can access our work. If you are interested in helping with design, construction, or documentation, please let Jessica know!

## Humanities and STEAM Day

Each summer, we host a day-long event where local students get the chance to attend multiple workshops (and get a free lunch). The event is an opportunity aimed at helping 5th-10th grade students develop broad interdisciplinary interests by showing the fun and interesting areas in which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics intersect with the arts and humanities. Grad students from various departments volunteer to teach 50-minute workshops on areas where STEM and the humanities collide. Planning is starting for this year's event, and if you are interested in being involved, please reach out!

## Organized by our undergraduate friends: [Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/rochester-ny/)!  

Casual astronomy presentations on the third Tuesday each month at 7:30pm from scientists in a laid back pub environment.
