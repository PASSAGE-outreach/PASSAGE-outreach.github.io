## Winslow Elementary Math/STEM Night

We will be participating in STEM Night at Winslow Elementary School! We will be showing demos to elementary school students and their families, getting kids excited about science. It takes place on Wednesday, February 11th from 6-7pm. If you are interested in volunteering, please let Jessica know! 

## New for 2026:  From the Abacus to AI: A Portable and Hands-on Museum of Computation   

We received an APS FEd grant for a family-friendly portable computation museum where participants will explore the history of computing. The goal is to design and construct demos showing the history of computers from the abacus to neural nets, as well as document the process and make it digitally accessible so that anyone interested in similar demos can access our work. If you are interested in helping with design, construction, or documentation, please let Jessica know!

## Organized by our undergraduate friends: [Astronomy on Tap](https://astronomyontap.org/locations/rochester-ny/)!  

Casual astronomy presentations on the third Tuesday each month at 7:30pm from scientists in a laid back pub environment.
