## APS PhysicsQuest
APS PhysicsQuest is a program that provides lesson plans and kits for middle and high school teachers to help make physics accessible. In honor of the International Year of Quantum, this year’s theme was Quantum: The Future State. We created a [Dancing Matter](https://www.aps.org/learning-resources/dancing-matter) activity to teach students about X-ray crystallography, which was accepted and included as a project in this year’s program. The video explanation can be found [here]([https://astronomyontap.org/locations/rochester-ny/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO-2KZfL4q0&list=PLgxD9DiwxLGp_3vj3biSPG88gIyU6Vzpz&index=8)) on the APS YouTube channel.

## Spooky Science Saturday with SPS - Featuring the House of Illusions (funded by a student-led American Physical Society grant)
A NYSS-APS grant allowed us to debut the House of Illusions at Spooky Science Day in 2025! The House of Illusions is a science museum-style exhibit themed as a haunted house. We built and displayed several classical illusions, teaching visitors about the science behind the deception. Thanks to all the volunteers who made this possible!

## RMSC Perseids Fest and Space Week
PASSAGE Outreach has participated in several events at the Rochester Museum and Science Center, including at Perseids Fest this fall and the Space Week Spring Break program. These events give volunteers an opportunity to share the love of science with the broader community, showing off demos and teaching families.

## Optics Family Night
In 2024 we volunteered with our friends in the Optics Department for their U of R Optics Family Night! This is a family-friendly event where kids of all ages are given the opportunity to participate in optics experiments and watch some mesmerizing demos. 

## Humanities and STEAM Day at the University of Rochester
Each summer, we host a day-long event where local students get the chance to attend multiple workshops (and get a free lunch). The event is an opportunity aimed at helping 5th-10th grade students develop broad interdisciplinary interests by showing the fun and interesting areas in which science, technology, engineering, and mathematics intersect with the arts and humanities. Grad students from various departments volunteer to teach 50-minute workshops on areas where STEM and the humanities collide. Example classes from this year include Cosmic Cartography and Optics, Art, and the World Around You.

## More Community Outreach
We show science demos at a variety of local events, including the ROC Public Market and programs like STEM Nights at local schools. These present an opportunity to show how science can be fun, interesting, and accessible to the general public.  See below for a list of more of our past community events!
